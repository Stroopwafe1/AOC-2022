## Notes

Day 12 took me the longest by far. I was making dumb mistakes and was also struggling with Rust's borrow checker for ~5.5 hours.
Which is why I eventually switched to C++ for today.

## Build step
Do yourself a favour and run in optimised, non-debug mode.

```console
$ g++ src/main.cpp -O3 -o main && ./main input.txt
```
